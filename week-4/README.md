# RECrypto Challenge: 3.Endianness16

This is a CTF challenge, which can be solved either with the combination of Reverse Engineering and Cryptography or just with Cryptography (only if you can understand what's going on!).

You are given an executable file (**`ctf.exe`**) for Microsoft Windows - x86_64, from which you have to retrieve the flag.

## Guidelines

- Make sure to stay within the attack surface, which is limited to **`ctf.exe`**, and not the other assets on which this executable file depends upon.

- The challenge is fairly easy if you can figure out what the challenge title states. The entire challenge is based upon the challenge title; i.e. **3.Endianness16**.

- The flag is in the **`flag{flag_here}`** format.
