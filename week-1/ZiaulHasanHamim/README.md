# WEEK 1:  This is my solution to csv to json. 
In my solution i used c# with dotnet 5. c# has got some really great libraries for working with csv and json (in the standard lib). But Here i didn't use any standard or third party lib. This a solution from scartch.

> Requirement: .net 5

RUN: `dotnet run -c release -- <csvFilename>` or you can first build and then run the exe

OUTPUT: result.json will be created!!
