1. Download the file.

2. Unzip the file.

3. After extracting we get a Folder name as : Find flag from unmounted disk

4. Let's use binwalk to extract all things from that file :

binwalk --extract -D=".*" 'Find flag from unmounted disk'

5. Move to the folder:

cd '_Find flag from unmounted disk.extracted'

6. strings 0.ext | grep FLAG

Here,you got your flag.

FLAG-ggmgk05096
